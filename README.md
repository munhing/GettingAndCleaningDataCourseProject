# Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project for `Getting and Cleaning Data` from `Coursera`. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The assignment is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

In addition to the above requirements, I have also inserted codes at the beginning of the code file that will automatically download the source material and unzip it into a folder called `UCI HAR Dataset` and eventually set the working directory to that folder.
